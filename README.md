Forward genetics, in which mutations are randomly generated in the genome of an animal model, is a classic method to uncover genes that affect biological processes and provide insight into human genetic disorders. Yet, despite being used as a major tool in genetics for decades, there is still a major challenge in identifying the causative mutations and underlying genes. [Dr. Adam Miller's lab](https://www.adammillerlab.com/) at the University of Oregon has developed an RNA-seq-based method that can identify the causative mutation and examine the related gene regulatory changes in mutants. Implementation of the methodology has been hampered by the lack of a modern, accessible bioinformatic pipeline that would provide broad useability to the community.

This project aims to facilitate the ability of geneticists to gain insight into the genetics of development and disease. This repository is the backbone of scripts that are used for the tool's [web-based interface](https://github.com/ramzymulla/RNAmApp).
